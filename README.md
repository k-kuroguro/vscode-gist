Access your GitHub Gists within Visual Studio Code. You can add, edit, and delete public and private gists.

## Installation

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and narrow down the list commands by typing `extension`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extensions`.
Select the `Gist Extension` extension from the list.

## GitHub Profiles

_**NOTE:** You must provide a personal access token to be authenticated with GitHub or a GitHub Enterprise instance._

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and type `select profile` to initialize the profile selector. You can add as many profiles as you would like.

If you are using a GitHub Enterprise account, be sure to add the appropriate API url. This extension uses the REST v3 API by GitHub. Your GHE API url should look similar to this: `http(s)://[hostname]/api/v3` [(documentation)](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.13/v3/#schema)

## Usage

### Create Gists

You must have a file open and active to create a gist.

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and enter the following:

~~~
GIST: Create New Gist
~~~

You will be prompted a gist description.

### Open/Edit Gists

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and enter one fo the following:

~~~
GIST: Open Gist
GIST: Open Favorite Gist
~~~

All files associated with the gist will be opened in group layout.

Once you have opened an **owned*** gist, saving it will commit a new revision.

\* an owned gist is one created by you, not a favorited (starred) gist.

You can also use the following commands:

~~~
GIST: Delete Gist
GIST: Delete File
GIST: Add File
GIST: Open Gist In Browser
GIST: Insert Text From Gist File
GIST: Insert Text From Favorite Gist File
~~~

## Extension Settings

Mostly you will not need to change these settings.

| Setting | Type | Default Value | Purpose |
|:--------|:-----|:--------------|:--------|
| maxFiles | Number | 10 | The maximum number of files to open without a prompt. |
| defaultPrivate | Boolean | false | Defaults all newly created Gists to PRIVATE. |
| profileOptions | Object | {} | Override profile configuration options. |

`profileOptions` gives you some debugging capabilities. You can provide a profile name along with `key`, `url`, and `rejectUnauthorized` values. Before you can use `profileOptions` you \*MUST\* have the profile created.

```js
interface ProfileOptions {
    key?: string; // the personal access token to use
    url?: string; // the REST endpoint to use
    rejectUnauthorized?: boolean; // set this to false if you are having ssl issues with your enterprise REST endpoint
}
```

An example value for `profileOptions` would be something like this:
```js
{
    "GHE": { // "GHE" MUST correspond with the name used when originally configuring the profile
        "rejectUnauthorized": false
    }
}
```
